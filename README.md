# recs.

**Share what you actually enjoy.**  
A lightweight social platform where people post recommendations (“recs”) they genuinely like — music, videos, books, podcasts, films, articles, fashion, and more.

## What is a “rec”?
A **rec** is a simple post that answers:

> “This is what I’m into right now — and why you should check it out.”

Instead of chasing trends, **recs** is built for sharing things with friends (or people you “tune into”) in a clean, minimal feed.
